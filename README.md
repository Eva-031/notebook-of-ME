## 🎯 Repository Goal

This repository is a personal learning notebook focused on **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)**  
for aerospace and space systems.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals in:
- Motion modeling & dynamics
- State estimation and sensor fusion
- Guidance logic and control design
- Simulation-driven engineering thinking

## PID Gain Comparison (Simulation)

The following result shows the effect of different **Kp values**
on a 1D point-mass position control system.
